[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) bindings for [Python](https://www.python.org/), including tools for creating native Python extension modules. Running and interacting with Python code from a Rust binary is also supported.

## Usage

PyO3 supports the following software versions:
  - Python 3.6 and up (CPython, PyPy, and GraalPy)
  - Rust 1.41 and up

You can use PyO3 to write a native Python module in Rust, or to embed Python in a Rust binary. The following sections explain each of these in turn.

### Using Rust from Python

PyO3 can be used to generate a native Python module. The easiest way to try this out for the first time is to use [`maturin`](https://github.com/PyO3/maturin). `maturin` is a tool for building and publishing Rust-based Python packages with minimal configuration. The following steps set up some files for an example Python module, install `maturin`, and then show how build and import the Python module.

First, create a new folder (let's call it `string_sum`) containing the following two files:

**`Cargo.toml`**

```toml
[package]
name = "string-sum"
version = "0.1.0"
edition = "2018"

[lib]
name = "string_sum"
# "cdylib" is necessary to produce a shared library for Python to import from.
#
# Downstream Rust code (including code in `bin/`, `examples/`, and `tests/`) will not be able
# to `use string_sum;` unless the "rlib" or "lib" crate type is also included, e.g.:
# crate-type = ["cdylib", "rlib"]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]

[dependencies.pyo3]
version = "0.15.2"
features = ["extension-module"]
```

**`src/lib.rs`**

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;

/// Formats the sum of two numbers as string.
#[pyfunction]
fn sum_as_string(a: usize, b: usize) -> PyResult<String> {
    Ok((a + b).to_string())
}

/// A Python module implemented in Rust. The name of this function must match
/// the `lib.name` setting in the `Cargo.toml`, else Python will not be able to
/// import the module.
#[pymodule]
fn string_sum(_py: Python, m: &PyModule) -> PyResult<()> {
    m.add_function(wrap_pyfunction!(sum_as_string, m)?)?;

    Ok(())
}
```

With those two files in place, now `maturin` needs to be installed. This can be done using Python's package manager `pip`. First, load up a new Python `virtualenv`, and install `maturin` into it:

```bash
$ cd string_sum
$ python -m venv .env
$ source .env/bin/activate
$ pip install maturin
```

Now build and execute the module:

```bash
$ maturin develop
# lots of progress output as maturin runs the compilation...
$ python
>>> import string_sum
>>> string_sum.sum_as_string(5, 20)
'25'
```

As well as with `maturin`, it is possible to build using [`setuptools-rust`](https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust) or [manually](https://pyo3.rs/latest/building_and_distribution.html#manual-builds). Both offer more flexibility than `maturin` but require further configuration.

### Using Python from Rust

To embed Python into a Rust binary, you need to ensure that your Python installation contains a shared library. The following steps demonstrate how to ensure this (for Ubuntu), and then give some example code which runs an embedded Python interpreter.

To install the Python shared library on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

Start a new project with `cargo new` and add  `pyo3` to the `Cargo.toml` like this:

```toml
[dependencies.pyo3]
version = "0.15.2"
features = ["auto-initialize"]
```

Example program displaying the value of `sys.version` and the current user name:

```rust
use pyo3::prelude::*;
use pyo3::types::IntoPyDict;

fn main() -> PyResult<()> {
    Python::with_gil(|py| {
        let sys = py.import("sys")?;
        let version: String = sys.getattr("version")?.extract()?;

        let locals = [("os", py.import("os")?)].into_py_dict(py);
        let code = "os.getenv('USER') or os.getenv('USERNAME') or 'Unknown'";
        let user: String = py.eval(code, None, Some(&locals))?.extract()?;

        println!("Hello {}, I'm Python {}", user, version);
        Ok(())
    })
}
```
